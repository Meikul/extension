								<strong>Dr. Chris Rogers</strong>
								is the Chief Scientific Officer and co-founder of Exemplar Genetics. He received his Ph.D. in pharmacology from Vanderbilt University focusing on gene therapy. He then completed post-doctoral training at the University of Iowa where he and colleagues created the first knockout and knockin models of a human disease in a large animal species - cystic fibrosis in pigs. This work led to the founding of Exemplar Genetics in 2008. The company is focused on the development and characterization of large animal models of human disease and providing housing, husbandry, and logistical support for research using these models. At Exemplar Genetics, Dr. Rogers has generated models of cardiovascular disease, cancer, cardiac arrhythmia, muscular dystrophy, several neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, and polycystic kidney disease, among many others. Exemplar Genetics was acquired by Intrexon in 2015.

								<strong>Dr. Tad Sonstegard</strong>
								is currently chief scientific officer of Acceligen, a Recombinetics company, where he leads both business development and research efforts dedicated to discovery of causative sequence variants in food animals. The goal is to apply genome editing for livestock genetic improvement that promotes sustainability and animal welfare. Previously at the USDA-ARS Beltsville, he led a genomics research program developing applications in germplasm conservation and genetic improvement that included the first commercially successful, ag-based SNP tool. He also identified causative variation affecting fertility and thermo-tolerance in cattle and has led consortia to generate genome assemblies of the water buffalo, goat, Zebu cattle, and an expression atlas of cattle. Dr. Sonstegard received his undergraduate degree from Iowa State University and his Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota. His has published 191 peer-reviewed articles and has received award recognition for his work in genomic research for livestock genetic improvement.

								<strong>Dr. Bhanu Telugu</strong>
								is an assistant professor at University of Maryland-College Park, and a "visiting scientist" in the Animal Bioscience and Biotechnology Laboratory at USDA, ARS, Beltsville, MD. Dr. Telugu is also a founding member, president &amp; CEO of RenOVAte Biosciences Inc., a livestock genetic engineering company. Primary research interests of his laboratory and his company are genetic engineering/biotechnology and reproductive biology. The laboratory employs genome editing tools such as CRISPRs for site-specifically altering the genome in large animal models such as pig for agricultural and biomedical applications. Specifically, genome editing tools are employed to alter alleles to facilitate "rational selection" of agricultural traits. The laboratory is actively engaged in developing porcine models of human disease (diabetes, cardiovascular disease and obesity), and developing technologies for transplantation research where pig is a preferred animal model.

								<strong>Dr. Kenneth L. White</strong>
								has been a faculty member in the Department of Animal, Dairy, and Veterinary Sciences at Utah State University since 1991 and was previously a faculty member at Louisiana State University. He was appointed vice president for USU Extension, dean of the College of Agriculture and Applied Sciences, and director of the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station at Utah State University July 1, 2013, following a national search. He received his Bachelor of Science degree in animal science from Brigham Young University in 1979, and his master's degree in animal science and Ph.D. in physiology from the University of California-Davis, in 1982 and 1986, respectively. He has generated over $15 million in extramural funding to support research in animal reproduction and embryonic development. In 2006, he was recognized as the USU's Researcher of the Year, and in 2013, Dr. White received the Utah Governor's Medal for Science and Technology in Academics in recognition of his research program and efforts to establish a School of Veterinary Medicine in Utah. He has published over 100 peer-reviewed scientific articles in journals such as Science, Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, Biology of Reproduction, and Cloning and Stem Cells. He led the nuclear transfer team that produced the world's first cloned equines, which resulted in the birth of three identical mule foals.

								<strong>Bruce Whitelaw</strong>
								was awarded a BSc degree in medical microbiology (virology elective) from the University of Edinburgh in 1982 and his PhD in 1987 from the University of Glasgow. His career has been dedicated to the development and application of gene expression systems in genetically engineered animals. Bruce is currently deputy director (Partnerships) at The Roslin Institute where holds the Genus Chair in Animal Biotechnology. Building from early work in transgenic livestock as bioreactors of human biomedical proteins in milk, Bruce has pioneered the use of lentivirus vectors for transgene delivery and more recently genome editors for precise genetic engineering of livestock. He seeks to apply this technology in the field of animal biotechnology, specifically to develop novel ways to combat infectious disease in animals, evaluate strategies to enhance overall reproductive efficiency, devise novel protein production systems and explore opportunities to develop new treatments of disease through appropriate genetically engineered animal models. His interest and expertise in animal biotechnology includes the development of innovative in vitro driven assisted reproductive technologies. Bruce is a member of the BBVA Foundation's Frontiers of Science Award in Biomedicine Jury; is on the Scientific Advisory Board of Roslin Technologies Ltd, Immunogenes Ag and Recombinetics Inc; is chairman of Edinburgh Genomics, a director on the Board of Edinburgh Research and Innovation (a University of Edinburgh subsidiary) and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Biology.

                <strong>Dr. Tom Wishart</strong>
                gained his Ph.D. in molecular and cellular neuroscience in 2006 and has since contributed to >50 manuscripts. His research focused on developing methods to identify factors regulating the stability of the nervous system in health and disease. This was primarily through a combination of anatomically dictated molecular analyses of differentially vulnerable neuronal populations. In 2011 he took up a junior group leader position at the Roslin Institute, which drove his research to include comparisons across a diverse array of model systems and to develop the capability to move seamlessly between pathological assessment and molecular analysis of mammalian (including but not limited to murine, ovine & equine) neuronal systems, through to in silico identification of potential regulatory cascades, and lower order model-based in vivo assessment of candidate ability to modulate neuronal morphology and/or stability. His group’s multi-species comparative approaches have been published as recommended workflows for novel therapeutic target identification. Tom was promoted to Reader in Molecular Anatomy in 2017 and is the co-head of Translational Biomarker discovery for the Centre of Dementia Prevention.

He had postdoctoral training at the University of New Orleans (2005-2007), after which, he worked at the University of Missouri-Columbia/National Swine Research and Resource Center as a research assistant professor from 2007-2010. He joined the State Key Laboratory of Reproductive Biology at the Institute of Zoology, CAS, as a principle investigator and group leader of "Genetic modifications in large animals," supported by CAS "100 Talents" Program in 2010. His research has focused on making genetic modifications in pigs for improvement of pig economic traits and biomedical research by two strategies: 1. Mutagenesis by ENU; 2. Somatic Cell Nuclear Transfer (SCNT) combined with transgenic/gene targeting.
