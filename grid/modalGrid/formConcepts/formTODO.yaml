Steps
  -Make form on ou that has required data so schema is cool
  -Submit data w/ for and look at the post it's sending
    -To find post go to Network in the inspector
    -Remember to get uuid from that
  -make jquery that'll make a string like that
  -make jquery to post string


  -Notes
    -With select fields have a hidden text or select field that the submit click
    handler jquery injects the selected into.

Look into having a hidden form (maybe a copy of the generated form) that you can
just jquery serialize instead of making your own post string. That'd probably be
less efficient. Maybe if this string thing doesn't work.

-Also make a hidden form element on the page that is cloned instead of having a
huge html string. maybe the browser will even cache it if we're lucky
